How to Run my Code (If packages not dowloaded Globally or not in Jupyter Site)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps (First Time running or If you Cannot Run the Jupyter File):
1. Change into Peter Portion Directory
    Command: cd '.\Peter Portion\'
2. Run the virtual Environment
    Command: '.\.venv\Scripts\activate'
3. Install the Kernal (This step only needs to be done once)
    Command: 'python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name "AML-Assignment-2"'
4. Navigate to main.ipynb
5. Click on "Select Kernal" and select "AML-Assignment-2"
6. Run the main.ipynb


NOTE: You May not need to perform any of these steps at all, it is just if you Cannot
get it to run. You may also not even need to activate the Virtual Environment
