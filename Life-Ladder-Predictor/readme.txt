Overview:
--------------------------
The life ladder predictor attempts to use social features (i.e Country Name, GDP, Generosity, etc...)
to predict where a country input is on the life ladder (A term used that describes wellness of life).

To do this, my predictor will explore the use of lienar regression, polynomial regression, and regularization 
on the happiness dataset - which contains features from various conteries over several years.
